The Titanic Survival Predictor is an interactive web-based application designed to estimate the survival probability of individuals aboard the Titanic, based on certain input parameters. It's built upon a machine learning model trained on the actual passenger data from the Titanic, taking into account factors such as class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket fare, whether the passenger was traveling alone, and the port of embarkation.
